# AWS Cloud Control API
AWS Cloud Control API is a set of common application programming interfaces (APIs) that make it easy for developers and partners to manage the lifecycle of AWS and third-party services. Cloud Control API provides five operations for developers to create, read, update, delete, and list (CRUDL) their cloud infrastructure.

#### Create, read, update, delete, and list AWS and third-party resources
AWS Cloud Control API makes it easy for developers to consistently manage hundreds of AWS resources as well as third-party resources using standardized APIs. As an example, you can use Cloud Control API to create any supported cloud resource using a common CreateResource API.
#### Expose new AWS resources to customers automatically
AWS Cloud Control API remains up-to-date with the latest AWS resources, enabling Amazon partners to integrate their own solutions with Cloud Control API just once, and then automatically access the new AWS services and features without assuming additional integration work.
#### Provision resources with third-party infrastructure tools
Cloud Control API provides developers with the ability to provision AWS resources with partner infrastructure tools such as HashiCorp Terraform and Pulumi.
